v1.0 (rev A)	11/19/2004	MAS
-----------------------------------
- Initial version
- Imported from RTD Finland
- Documented for ISO9000



v2.0.0 (rev B)	03/01/2005	RWB
-----------------------------------
- Combined the version 1.0 files dm6814drv.tar.gz, dm6814lib.tar.gz, and
  dm6814samples.tar.gz into the single file dm6814_Linux_v2.0.0.tar.gz
- Deleted all version 1.0 example programs
- Imported DOS example programs and created new example and test programs

- CHANGES.TXT changes:
    * Documented changes in revision B

- driver/rtd-dm6814.c changes:
    * Modified driver to dynamically allocate a character device major number
    * Removed the debug module parameter
    * Removed the major module parameter
    * Removed the force module parameter
    * Removed support for sending signal to process when an interrupt occurs
    * Removed ioctl() request code for returning interrupt count
    * Implemented the read(2) system call to atomically return driver's
      interrupt count and cached IRQ Status Register value and optionally wait
      for an interrupt to occur
    * Implemented the select(2)/poll(2) system call to allow a process to wait
      inside kernel for an interrupt to occur without using signals
    * Interrupt handler changes:
	+ All interrupt status, not just P14 interrupts, is examined and all
	  interrupts are now acknowledged by the driver
	+ Handler now saves interrupt status register value whenever an
	  interrupt occurs
    * Reworked all ioctl() request processing code, including removing a lot of
      unnecessary requests which could be implemented with a simple read or
      write of I/O space
    * Updated code to work with 2.6 kernels
    * Changed names of device files
    * Modified driver to allocate resources for all devices when kernel module
      is loaded
    * Driver now clears all interrupt status and disables all interrupts when
      kernel module is loaded
    * When a device file is opened, all interrupts are disabled
    * Removed redundant flags structure member from DM6814 device descriptor;
      the io member variable in the structure also indicates whether or not a
      device has been initialized

- lib/librtd-dm6814.cpp changes:
    * Removed the following library functions which dealt with signals and
      interrupt notification:
	+ signal_handler()
	+ InstallISR()
	+ RemoveISR()
    * Appended 6814 to the end of all function names except for class
      constructors and destructors
    * Fixed bug in GetDriverVersion6814() that caused function to return
      without passing back driver version
    * Updated all ioctl() calls to reflect kernel changes
    * Removed the following obsolete public functions:
	+ DoneTimer()
	+ ClockDone()
	+ GetIRQCounter()
	+ EnableIRQ()
	+ DisableBoardIRQ()
	+ ClearIRQ()
	+ SetIRQPolarity()
	+ EnableIRQSharing()
	+ GetIRQStatus()
	+ ClearIrq()
	+ DisableIncEnc()
    * Created the following public functions:
	+ EnableGetIntStatusWait6814()
	+ GetIntStatus6814()
	+ InitBoard6814()
	+ LoadIRQRegister6814()
	+ ReadByte6814()
	+ WaitForInterrupt6814()
	+ WriteByte6814()
    * Reworked SetUserClock6814() so that it programs only a single
      timer/counter instead of all three timers
    * Updated OpenBoard6814() to use new device file names
    * Added a second parameter to ReadTimerCounter6814() which passes back the
      timer count so that the function return value is an error indication
    * Added a fourth parameter to SetUserClock6814() which passes back the
      actual frequency programmed so that the function return value is an error
      indication
    * Added second parameter to private function inb() which passes back the
      value read from I/O space so that the function return value is an error
      indication
    * Removed private member variable IRQ_Register from DM6814Device class
    * Created macros to set up value passed to LoadIRQRegister6814()
    * Created macros to interpret status register value returned by
      GetIntStatus6814()

- README.TXT changes:
    * Changed revision and version number of driver
    * Reworked entire file to meet RTD Linux standards

v2.1.0 (rev C)	04/30/2010	WJT
-----------------------------------
- driver/rtd-dm6814.c changes:
    * Modified driver for 2.6 compatibility up to 2.6.33.x
    * Fixed an issue with spin locks being held during functions that can sleep

- Fixes for the following FOGBUGZ cases: 
    *943, 961, 986
    
v2.2.0 (rev D)  04/17/2015      RGG
-----------------------------------
  * Modified driver for compatibility with kernel 3.8 and later
